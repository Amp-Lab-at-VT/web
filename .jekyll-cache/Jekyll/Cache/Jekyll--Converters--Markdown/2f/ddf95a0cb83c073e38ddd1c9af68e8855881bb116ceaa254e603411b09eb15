<p>Here at the Amp Lab, you are expected to update the website with the latest info for your project. To update the website, you will be using git. This tutorial uses the command line, but if you are comfortable you may use the Github GUI. For now, click one of the buttons below to install git.</p>

<a class="button is-link" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Install Git for Linux/Apple</a></p>

<p>It is also recommended that you install Visual Code Studio, a common IDE used in industry:</p>

<h3 id="part-a">Part A:</h3>
<p>Follow the steps below to get your repo all set up. This will make a folder in your home directory. Open a bash terminal to get started:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd
mkdir </span>AmpLab
<span class="nb">cd </span>AmpLab
git clone https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/web.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>web
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now that you‚Äôre in your folder, let‚Äôs open it in Visual Code and give you the quick overview. Type the following to open Visual Studio Code:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>code <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>From here, you can open a terminal in Visual Studio Code (Also just called VS code). See image below:</p>

<p><img src="/web/img/TutorialPhotos/Terminal.png" alt="amp-map" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Now we‚Äôre going to create a branch. It‚Äôs just like a tree: all core, working code happens on the <strong>main/master</strong> branch. All development happens on <strong>branches</strong>, which can be merged in. See this video for reference: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2TUommS3O0">Learn More About Branching and Merging</a></p>

<p><strong>Note that ‚ÄúName‚Äù can be whatever you want</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout <span class="nt">-b</span> ‚ÄúName‚Äù 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As a sanity check, try running the following command</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git branch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should see ‚Äúmain‚Äù and the name of your branch. The fact that your name is green and has a star next to it means you did this step properly!</p>

<p>Alright, we‚Äôre done with the CLI for now! Let‚Äôs start using Visual Code.</p>

<p>There are two folders you need to keep track of:  <strong>WARNING: DO NOT EDIT ANY OTHER FOLDERS. THESE ARE AUTO-GENERATED, AND SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED</strong></p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>img
_posts
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See below:</p>

<p><img src="/web/img/TutorialPhotos/usefulFolders.png" alt="amp-map" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>You will be putting all your files into these two locations. Make a copy of the project template found in <strong>_posts</strong> using the instructions below:</p>

<p><img src="/web/img/TutorialPhotos/copyTemplate2.png" alt="amp-map" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Now, rename the template. The dating scheme is <strong>year, month, day</strong>. This is critical! Also use a dash <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> as your word divider, <strong>instead of spaces</strong></p>
